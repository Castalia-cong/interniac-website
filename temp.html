        <h6 class='mb-1 mt-4 boldest'>What does a Real Estate Agent do?</h6>
        <p>Real estate agents arrange the selling/renting of property. They can help put buyers and sellers together and negotiate for their clients. Every time they successfully sell off a property, they are compensated with a percentage of the property’s purchase price. In this way, a real estate agent’s income is not entirely secure; their income is based on their ability to close a deal. Many states require agents to work with a real estate broker, a more experienced person or a brokerage firm. A real estate agent must have excellent communication skills as they will be talking with clients, other real estate agents, landlords, and more. They also need to be organized to arrange meetings between clients and sellers/renters. Real estate agents research properties and deal with real estate documents.</p>
